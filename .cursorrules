Match the Figma designs. Strive for pixel-perfection using Tailwind classes accurately.

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

Translate the above to relevant tailwind classes (not px values) and match the relevance with our tailwind config as well.

Make mindful and precise designs as precise to figma as possible. Use shadcn/ui components as much as possible (all in components/ui folder)

For any icon or logo, Define it in a tsx file, passing in color props, so it can be adjusted for dark mode.

Default to Server Components for efficiency; add "use client" only where needed for hooks (useState, useEffect, etc).

Keep TypeScript strict and maintain clean folder structures (e.g. app, components, lib).

Employ relative imports and logical file organization to promote clarity and maintainability.

Use types when making major changes to base shadcn components, as it could be used somewhere else too.
